# Inception-type-models
Understanding the architecture of inception-type models, i.e., functional models and not traditional sequential models through basic python coding. The architecture structure will also be plotted so as to visualise the flow in an easier way.
The code for model_simple.png is present in the notebook, however, other types of architectures are also added for a better understanding.
